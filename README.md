# Home-Automation
This project is about home automation, in which I have created a system that can automatically turn on or off home appliances (fans,led bulbs) based on environmental conditions using an Arduino Uno, an IC ULN2803, a motor, a lamp, a temperature sensor, a photo detector sensor, and a relay.
